Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

Ex.

Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]

		// `j` represents the "middle" element between `i` and `k`.
		// we will increment this up through the array while `i` and `k`

		// to summarize our setup, we have `i` that starts at the beginning,

		//
		// note that `i` is controlled by our outer for-loop and will move the slowest.
		// in the meantime, `j` and `k` will take turns inching towards each other depending
		// on some logic we'll set up below. once they collide, `i` will be incremented up
		// and we'll repeat the process.

				// this is important! we need to continue to increment `j` and decrement `k`
				// as long as those values are duplicated. in other words, we wanna skip values
				// we've already seen. otherwise, an input array of [-2,0,0,2,2] would result in
				// [[-2,0,2], [-2,0,2]].
